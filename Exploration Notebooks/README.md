## Notebooks

* __es-atlas-cern__ - understanding rucio events data in the main CERN ES instance. Functions to extract 'transfer-done' data and save them to dataframes.
* __chicago-instance__ - connecting to the UChicago ES instance (atlas-kibana.mwt2.org) and extracting data.
* __Feedforward_networks__ - some best performing feedforward neural networks.
* __parse_ddm_rse_endpoints__ - extracting all the rse(rucio storage element) enpoints for preprocessing the 'src-rse' and 'dst-rse' fields in the transfer's data.
* __raw_data_plots__ - notebook contaninig figures and plots demonstarting some common trends within the continous variables in the rucio-transfer data(duration, bytes, time-in-queue).
* __seasonal_trend_decompostion__ - applying seasonal time decompositon (from twitter) to rucio-transfer timeseries.
* __abc__ - `different deep learning model architectures and their performance plots`
* __outlier_detetion_alternatives__ - Contains some alternative algorithms like MAD and percentile based detections. None gave any exciting results
